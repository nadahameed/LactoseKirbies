Peer Reviewing Findings:
* we should add an achievements page
* we can add a timer
* we can use chat gpt to help us generate a framework first
* we can use an api for profile pictures
* viewing other people's profiles should be an option
==============================================================

* used chatgpt to generate code for pong and snake
* fooled around with different commands
* created working games for pong and snake
* customized games to make them kirby themed
* as of right now, they don't run in the flask app (it's a popup)
but never fear it'll be done soon
* fooled around with pygame's premade space invaders but it's
kind of hard to customize because it's an entirely new thing to learn
(but that's why we have jasmine's handy-dandy tutorial)
    - tried to customize it but it's very messy

* created space invaders (with ai's help)
* everything's customized and kirby-themed
* started working on routing to actually connect it to the flask app, that
will come soon
* as of right now, what's left to do is work on routing, high scores 
and its display (achievements page basically), host it on a domain,
and record a demo --> other video games are more of a stretch goal at this point
